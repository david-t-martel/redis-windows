# Redis for Windows - Complete Setup Summary

## 🎯 What Just Happened?

You now have a **fully functional Redis Windows service infrastructure** ready to run Redis on Windows with enterprise-grade features:

### ✅ What's Ready Now:
- **RedisService.exe** - Production-ready Windows service wrapper
- **redis.conf** - Optimized configuration file
- **Build automation** - PowerShell and batch scripts
- **Complete documentation** - Setup guides and quick-start
- **Service management** - Install/uninstall scripts

### 🔄 What's Still Needed:
- **Redis binaries** (`redis-server.exe`, `redis-cli.exe`) - Built via GitHub Actions

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Get Pre-built Redis (Fastest)
```powershell
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/david-t-martel/redis-windows/releases
# 2. Download: Redis-X.X.X-Windows-x64-with-Service.zip  
# 3. Extract to this directory
# 4. Run: .\start.bat
```

### Option 2: Build Redis via GitHub Actions
```powershell
# 1. Trigger the "Manual Build Redis" workflow on GitHub
# 2. Specify Redis version (e.g., "8.0.3")
# 3. Download the resulting artifacts
# 4. Extract to this directory
```

### Option 3: Use Current Service Framework
```powershell
# Test what we've built:
.\build.ps1

# Install as Windows service (requires Redis binaries):
# Run as Administrator:
sc.exe create Redis binpath="$(pwd)\RedisService.exe" start=auto
net start Redis
```

---

## 🏗️ What We Built

### Enhanced Redis Service Wrapper
- **Robust logging** with Windows Event Log integration
- **Process monitoring** and automatic restart capability
- **Configuration flexibility** with custom config file support
- **Error handling** with detailed diagnostics
- **Service lifecycle** management (start/stop/restart)

### Production-Ready Configuration
- **Security defaults** with localhost binding
- **Memory management** with eviction policies
- **Persistence options** (RDB snapshots + AOF logging)
- **Performance tuning** for Windows environments
- **Logging configuration** with rotation support

### Automation Scripts
- **Interactive setup** with `build.ps1`
- **One-click building** with error handling
- **Service installation** with verification
- **Testing and validation** tools

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Get Redis Binaries (Choose One):

**A. Download from Releases (Recommended)**
- Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/david-t-martel/redis-windows/releases)
- Download latest `Redis-X.X.X-Windows-x64-with-Service.zip`
- Extract `redis-server.exe` and `redis-cli.exe` to this directory

**B. Trigger GitHub Actions Build**
- Go to repository Actions tab

- Download artifacts when complete

### 2. Test Your Setup:
```powershell
# Once you have redis-server.exe:
.\start.bat                    # Start Redis
.\redis-cli.exe ping          # Test connection (should return PONG)
.\redis-cli.exe shutdown      # Stop Redis
```

### 3. Install as Service (Production):
```powershell
# Run as Administrator:
.\build.ps1
# Choose option 4: "Install as Windows service"
```
